In this task, we generated the Wordcloud for each of the input set categories. Wordcloud generation is a quite simple task. After a single pass to each document of each category the word frequencies for each category are generated. The Wordcloud of each frequency is generated with respect to these frequencies, were the size of a word image in the final word cloud results directly from its frequency. That is, the size of a word $a$ will be larger that the size of a word $b$ if $a$ has a higher frequency. For this task we used the WordCloud\footnote{https://amueller.github.io/word\_cloud/} python package.
