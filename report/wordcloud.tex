In this task, we generated the Wordcloud for each of the input set categories. Wordcloud generation is a quite simple task. After a single pass to each document of each category the word frequencies for each category are generated. Based on these frequencies the Wordcloud is generated, were the size of a word in the final word cloud results directly from its frequency. That is, the size of a word $a$ will be larger that the size of a word $b$ if $a$ has a higher frequency. For this task we used the WordCloud\footnote{https://amueller.github.io/word\_cloud/} python package.
