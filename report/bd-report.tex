\section{Abstract}
In this report we describe in detail the techniques that we used in the assignment of the Big Data Mining course. In summary, given an news input dataset the main goals of this assignment were to generate a Wordcloud for each possible category, duplicate detection with respect to the cosine distance metric, the implementation and evaluation of several state-of-the-art classification algorithms, as well as a custom architecture that overperforms the aforementioned state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of a number of evaluation metrics. Through experimental evaluation we showcase that our architecture achieves better performance for all of the evaluation metrics that we have used, including accuracy, precision, recall, ROC and F-Measure.
